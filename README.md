# Custom-form-with-PHP-backend

This was a project I worked on for a freelancer artist who wanted to be able to accept commisions from their clients and get that data to their email. After giving them the intial product I started working on it more. This code should be functioning , all that is needed is a gmail address and app password created for that email to use in the send php email file.
